# My-Superstore-data-analysis
I developed an excel project, creating a dashboard and tables to analyse the data.
Insights: *California has the highest number of sales so it needs more investment and continous marketing and the other locations also need increased marketing or inventory changes.				
*Consumer segment brings in more sales and profit while home office brings in less profit and sales				
*All the product categories generate high sales				
*Furniture under the product category has low profit despite having high sales which may be due to pricing or high cost.				
*Corporate has the highest profit in central locations.
